        <Page>The Cyan-Tailed Bukrad! Which is different than the Cyan-Bellied or Cyan-Horned Bukrad, which are all named Bukrads despite all being on different planets.</Page>
        <Page>Bukrads are actually found on many planets, usually within swamps! But not always! Did you know that no two Bukrad "species" are related!</Page>
        <Page>Despite having the same common name, Bukrads are actually not a genetic family! They all just fill the same economic niche, and evolve very similarly.</Page>
        <Page>This is because nature really likes to evolve a reptilian predator in swamps! Some Bukrads are up to four times the size of a Nomaian ship, whereas some are no bigger than the head of a staff!</Page>
        <Page>You can imagine the number of scrolls written on Bukrads! Fun fact! The Cyan-Tailed Bukrad only has six scrolls mention it! One of which is my Thesis Paper!</Page>
        <Page>I was born on the home planet of the Cyan-Tailed Bukrad! I grew up fascinated with them, but I found out there are only five scrolls that mentioned it, two of which are biographies of Nomai that were also born on my home planet.</Page>
        <Page>I loved going to the library and trying to find anything on them, as a xenobiologist! I ended up being the first Nomai to dissect one!</Page>
